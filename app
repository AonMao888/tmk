Firstly, we would like to thank to Kaw Dai, Muse for giving us the permission to use the songs they were recording. Most of the songs will play with Guitar and Male/Female voices. We believe it would be a great help for those who are practicing Dok Su songs, especially for the Guitarists. Moreover, the app also provides Read Mode function meaning you can turn off the song to see the lyrics of the song more clearly. Just simply click the speaker icon from above the Play Song Action Bar. We believe it will also provide a great help for those who would like to read only the lyrics without further disturbances, especially for the singers who are going to sing Dok Su songs.","screenshot1":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/8p3SVgJGOL636Y5_4OUcAkJYA1HWMYCPy5334ykjj8xnNqGPSChxZvCM2JxL6_vF0KnQ=w526-h296-rw","screenshot2":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/uRBgWIxapwY00u6W4XSbeNm1PfOFzBAgCg2xHdBxVTzKDbjKA26DcMVJE9Xq45-1fio=w526-h296-rw","screenshot3":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_5W4blMGB24gAiBjcQbStp2PbV4luuBxr84WxdQGlBVjwtO5QCtmv_KZvb0NMJYDuoA=w526-h296-rw","playstore":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.saimao.doksu","apkpure":"https://t.ly/EX-s","package":"it.saimao.doksu"}
